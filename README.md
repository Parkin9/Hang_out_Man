# Hang_out_Man
A simply game/project based on Miros≈Çaw Zelent's tutorial (http://miroslawzelent.pl/kurs-javascript/przetwarzanie-lancuchow-gra-wisielec/).
I want to add some back-end code. For example, reading codewords from external TXT file (which is already done) or a division into two players.
I used a clean JavaScript, but I'm going to implement a jQuery lib into this project.

Technologies:
JavaScript, Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Maven.
